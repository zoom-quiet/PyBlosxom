"""
A reStructuredText entry formatter for pyblosxom.  reStructuredText is 
part of the docutils project (http://docutils.sourceforge.net/).  To 
use, you need a *recent* version of docutils.  A development snapshot 
(http://docutils.sourceforge.net/#development-snapshots) will work fine.  

Install docutils, copy this file to your pyblosxom Pyblosxom/plugins
directory, and you're ready to go.  Files with a .rst extension will be
marked up as reStructuredText. 

You can configure this as your default preformatter for .t2t files by
configuring it in your config file as follows::

    py['parser'] = 'txt2tags'

or in your blosxom .txt file entries, place a '#parser txt2tags' line after the
title of your blog::

    My Little Blog Entry
    #parser txt2tags
    My main story...
